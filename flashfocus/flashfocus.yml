# I also would prefer that firefox windows are not flashed on focus:
#
# rules:
#   - window-class: firefox
#     flash-on-focus: False
#   - window-class: Termite
#     default-opacity: 0.8
#
#
# For more complicated rules, you can use (python-style) regexes:
#
# rules:
#   - window-id: ^(?!termite)$
#     default-opacity: 0.8

# Native wayland apps can be matched using the app_id and window name. These
# can be found using `swaymsg -t get_tree`. XWayland apps are matched with
# using WM_CLASS as above (this can also be found with `swaymsg`)
#
# Given that termite is wayland native and firefox is not, the rules above
# could instead be written:
#
# rules:
#   - window-class: firefox
#     flash-on-focus: False
#   - app-id: termite
#     default-opacity: 0.8
#
# rules:
#   - window-name: ^(?!termite)$
#     default-opacity: 0.8
